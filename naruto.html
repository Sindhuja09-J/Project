    <p>Naruto is a Japanese manga and anime series about a young ninja named Naruto Uzumaki who wants to become the leader of his village, the Hokage, to gain recognition. Ostracized by his village because a powerful fox demon was sealed inside him, Naruto strives to earn the respect of his peers through his often carefree, boisterous, and determined personality. </p>
